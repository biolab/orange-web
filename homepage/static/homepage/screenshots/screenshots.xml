<description>Clicking on a node of classification tree outputs the associated
data, which can be further processed in any other widget. Screenshot
below shows a schema where we use File widget to read the Iris
data set, construct a decision tree, and visualize it. Schema also
includes a scatterplot that displays the original data (the channel
from File widget), and also receives a data subset from Classification
Tree Viewer. The data subset is marked with filled dots. By clicking on
different nodes of the tree the selection in scatterplot changes,
making this schema an interesting interactive exploration tool.</description>
